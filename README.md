# AnomaData-

# Description

Automated anomaly detection for predictive maintenance is essential across various industries seeking to minimize risks and derive actionable insights from their equipment data. While system failures can occur in any machine, the ability to predict these failures and proactively address them is crucial for both machines and software applications. Predictive maintenance involves assessing equipment conditions through continuous monitoring, with the objective of performing maintenance before deterioration or breakdown occurs. This Capstone project focuses on predicting machine failures by detecting anomalies within the data.

# How to run the Code

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the EDA notebook: jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
3. Train the model: python notebooks/model_training.py


# Deployment
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Steps: Load and Use the Model
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import joblib

## Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('models/anomaly_detection_model.pkl')

## Load new data
new_data = pd.read_csv('data/new_data.csv')

### Example: Feature engineering, scaling, etc.
new_data['hour'] = pd.to_datetime(new_data['time']).dt.hour
new_data = new_data.drop(columns=['time'])

## Predict anomalies
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

## Output predictions
print(predictions)
